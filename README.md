# OnlineCoursePlatform-App



OnlineCoursesPlatform is a full-stack application for managing online courses. The backend is a Spring Boot service connected to a relational database (e.g., MySQL) and exposes REST endpoints for authentication plus CRUD operations on teachers, courses, and enrollments. The frontend is a modern React (Vite) app offering login, a dashboard with tabs for Teachers, Courses, and Enrollments, and forms that handle addTeacher, addCourse, addEnrollment, and updateCourse flows, all wired to the backend via Axios services.
